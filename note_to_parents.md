As-salām ʿalaykum parents,

Next Saturday, December 15th, is the last class for 2018. The final exam will begin promptly at 9:00am *in-shāʾ-Allāh*. Students are encouraged to arrive by 8:30am for any last minute studying or questions.
After, we'll go to Sky Zone for 2 hours of fun, jumping, and games. Please fill out [ISIA's Permission Slip](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1z1bs4PsIbjLIpvPJDgGFlfzY4vXo9FCk) and bring it before the final if you have not already.
**Note that Sky Zone has their own online [Waiver Form](https://westminsterstore.skyzone.com/waiver/WaiverInfo.aspx) so please fill that out as well.**
After the fun and games, we'll return to ISOC for Ẓuhr, and have lunch, awards, and prizes.

Students will be free for pickup around 2:15pm *in-shāʾ-Allāh*.

**Note:** ISIA will be holding Parent-Teacher Conferences on Saturday, January 5th. More details regarding that will be sent soon.
