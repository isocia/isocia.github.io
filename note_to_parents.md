As-salām ʿalaykum parents,

Next Saturday, December 15th, is the last class for 2018. The final exam will begin promptly at 9:00am *in-shāʾ-Allāh*. Students are **encouraged to arrive by 8:30am** for any last minute studying or questions.
After, we'll go to Sky Zone for 2 hours of fun, jumping, and games. Please fill out [ISIA's Permission Slip](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1z1bs4PsIbjLIpvPJDgGFlfzY4vXo9FCk) and bring it before the final if you have not already.
After the fun and games, we'll return to ISOC for Ẓuhr, and have lunch, awards, and prizes.
Students will be free for pickup around 2:15pm *in-shāʾ-Allāh*.

**Note: Sky Zone has their own online [*Waiver Form*](https://westminsterstore.skyzone.com/waiver/WaiverInfo.aspx) so please fill that out as well.**
