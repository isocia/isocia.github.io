As-salām ʿalaykum parents,

This Saturday, January 5th is is our Parent Teacher Conference. It will be held on the second floor of the Masjid in the side room. Please try and arrive 5 minutes before your scheduled time.

We will be returning back students' work, finals, and extra credit, and providing feedback on your child's performance in the class. This is a great time for you as parents, or us as teachers to bring up any issues that may be of concern. Lastly, we will be returning the remaining deposit for the first semester, and collecting the $100 deposit for the second semester (cash or check made out to ISOC).

We are more than happy to address and if your questions or concerns. May Allāh ﷻ bless us all, Āmīn!

Wa ʿalaykum as-salām
